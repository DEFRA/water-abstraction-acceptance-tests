# Water Abstraction acceptance tests

> WIP: We are still in the process of migrating our existing tests from the [water-abstraction-ui](https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-ui). It uses Cypress v8 and does not have test isolation. It therefore is not a simple copy & paste exercise.

These acceptance tests support the [Manage your water abstraction or impoundment licence service](https://manage-water-abstraction-impoundment-licence.service.gov.uk/) and it's internal counterpart.

They are maintained by the [Water Abstraction Team](https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-team).

## Pre-requisites

You just need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, ideally an LTS version and no less than v16.

You'll also need [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/). It's what we use when working on the tests, and is one of 2 browsers available to our internal users.

## Installation

First clone the repository and then drop into your new local repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-acceptance-tests.git && cd water-abstraction-acceptance-tests
```

Next download and install the dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

## Configuration

> Important! Do not add environment files to source control

We have 4 environments the tests can run against; local, development, test, and pre-production.

Each has its own [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) config file stored in `environments/`.

### Environment files

The config or 'environment' files hold environment variables which are key-value pairs; _name of the thing_ and the _value of the thing_. For example, `"defaultPassword": "P@55word"`. These are grouped by `config` and `values`.

- `config` is used to configure Cypress itself
- `values` are used within the tests and accessible via [Cypress.env()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/env)

You tell Cypress which environment to use by which [npm run script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-run-script) you launch from [package.json](/package.json), for example `npm run cy:open:tst`.

Using these `*.json` files allows us to store both config and credentials that change across environments in one place but it is important they are _**never**_ committed to source control.

Checkout [environments/example.json](/environments/example.json) for an example of the file you'll need to create for each environment.

## Execution

You can run tests using the Cypress test runner or headless using the Cypress CLI.

### Test runner

> Cypress runs tests in a unique interactive runner that allows you to see commands as they execute while also viewing the application under test.

To open the test runner use `npm run cy:open:[env]` replacing `[env]` with your chosen environment

```bash
npm run cy:open:tst
```

### CLI

> Runs Cypress tests to completion. By default, it will run all tests headless in the Electron browser.

<img src="docs/cli.png" width="800" alt="Screenshot of cli" />

To open the CLI use `npm run cy:run:[env]` replacing `[env]` with your chosen environment

```bash
npm run cy:run:tst
```

## Reporting

When Cypress is [run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run), for example `npm run cy:run:tst`, a HTML report of the results is automatically generated.

## VSCode tasks

Currently, the whole team uses [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) when working on the service. So, we like to add custom [tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) to our repos, both to make our lives easier and as a way of documenting some of the things you can do.

You access the tasks using the [Command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) (‚áß‚åòP). With the palette open search for **Run test task** and once highlighted select it. You'll then be shown a list of helper tasks, for example.

- **üì∫ Open (Tests)**
- **üìª Run (Tests)**
- **üìã Report (Tests)**

Feel free to check them out! üòÅ
